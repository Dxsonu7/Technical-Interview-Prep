# Technical Interview Prep

This repository is a collection of technical coding problems that I have solved to prepare for technical interviews. These questions are solved in Java. I am planning on solving LC questions every weekend.

Topics (from [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice) and Leetcode): Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Stack, Binary Search, Linked List, Trees, Tries, Heap/Priority Queue, Backtracking, Graphs, 1-D Dynamic Programming (DP), 2-D Dynamic Programming (DP), Greedy, Intervals, Math & Geometry, Bit Manipulation, Matrix, and Sorting.
